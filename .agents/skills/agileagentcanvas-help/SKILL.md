# Agile Agent Canvas — Help & Skill Router

You have access to the **full Agile Agent Canvas** skill catalogue (81 skills and agents). When a user asks for help or describes a task, use this catalogue to identify the best matching skill(s) and then load and execute them.

## How to Use

1. **Match** — Given a user request, scan the catalogue below and identify the top 1–3 most relevant skills by matching the user's intent to skill descriptions.
2. **Present** — Show the user a brief numbered list of matches with a one-sentence reason why each fits.
3. **Load & Execute** — When the user selects a skill (or if there's only one strong match), READ the full contents of the skill file at the path shown in the catalogue, resolve template variables, and follow the skill's instructions completely.
4. **If unsure** — Ask the user a clarifying question, then re-match.

## Variable Resolution

In all BMAD skill files, template variables resolve as follows:

| Variable | Resolves To |
|----------|-------------|
| `{bmad-path}` | `c:/Users/enzo1/.vscode-insiders/extensions/msayedshokry.agileagentcanvas-0.5.2/resources/_aac` |
| `{project-root}` | The workspace/project root directory |
| `{skill-root}` | `c:/Users/enzo1/.vscode-insiders/extensions/msayedshokry.agileagentcanvas-0.5.2/resources/_aac/skills` |
